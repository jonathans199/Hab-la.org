                    <p>smart cities : planning Urban planning has direct consequences on the population. It can promote equality as much as it can increase the social gap between different sectors with catastrophic consequences for all its citizens. Furthermore, the survival of these cities depends on the decisions made now. The move from rural settings into the cities will only keep growing and cities will need to have the flexibility to accommodate for this growth. Technologies will need to be implemented to make the necessary shifts in how resources are used for the demand increase of housing, employment and education. Governments will need to look at how their economy is handled both locally and globally and its impact on the population to make sure affected economic sectors will have room for adjustment. The agricultural sector, for example, sees itself heavily wedged by international trade agreements in which local products lose value, causing their producers (in this case farmers) to move elsewhere for economic opportunities.</p>
